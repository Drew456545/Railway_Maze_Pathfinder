# Railway_Maze_Pathfinder
This project takes a Railway maze as a PPM file and a config file which specifies some constraints such as angle, pixel value, start and end points, 
and finds the shortest path then outputs it onto another PPM file.

The constraints are to simulate an actual train, so only gradual turning must be enforced as well as a no reversal rule that must be enforced.

Passenger constraints were also added which were 4 points on the maze. 3/4 points must be visited before the end goal is reached.
